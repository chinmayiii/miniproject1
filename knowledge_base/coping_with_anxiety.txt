When you feel anxious or overwhelmed, it can be helpful to ground yourself in the present moment. One popular technique is the 5-4-3-2-1 method. First, pause and look for five separate things you can see. Second, listen for four distinct sounds. Third, notice three things you can feel with your skin, like the texture of your clothes or the surface of a table. Fourth, identify two different things you can smell. Finally, notice one thing you can taste. This exercise pulls your focus away from anxious thoughts and back into your body and your environment.

Another powerful tool is controlled breathing. Try the box breathing technique: breathe in slowly for four seconds, hold your breath for four seconds, breathe out slowly for four seconds, and then hold your breath for four seconds. Repeat this cycle several times. This can help calm your nervous system. Remember, it's okay to feel anxious, and these feelings will pass. Be patient and kind to yourself.
