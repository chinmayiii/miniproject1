Self-care is about performing small, kind acts for yourself to support your mental and physical well-being. It doesn't have to be complicated. Here are some simple ideas.

For your mind:
- Listen to a favorite album or a calming playlist.
- Watch a comfort movie or a funny TV show.
- Read a chapter of a book.
- Unfollow social media accounts that make you feel bad.
- Do a simple puzzle like a crossword or sudoku.

For your body:
- Take a 15-minute walk outside, and notice the nature around you.
- Do some gentle stretching.
- Drink a large glass of water.
- Prepare a simple, nourishing meal that you enjoy.
- Take a warm bath or shower.

For your soul:
- Cuddle with a pet.
- Spend a few minutes doodling or drawing, with no goal in mind.
- Light a candle with a scent you love.
- Write down three things you are grateful for, no matter how small.
- Tidy up one small area of your room to create a more peaceful space.

It's important to be kind to yourself, especially when you're feeling low. Sometimes a small act of self-care can make a difference. Have you considered doing something simple like listening to a favorite song, taking a short walk, or just tidying up one small part of your room to create a more peaceful space?
